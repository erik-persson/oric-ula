------------------

001_top_unprocessed.v
    Raw transistor netlist provided by Mike Connors
    Generated from a die photograph. P and N transistors are represented
    by module instances (generic_pmos and generic_nmos).

002_top_processed.v
    Partially converted netlist from Mike Connors
    This file replaces many transistors with Verilog gate primitives and
    transmission gates (generic_cmos).

006_mjb_sorted.v
    Processed and organized by Mike Brown. This includes several manual
    corrections, and rich annotation of gate-level structures.

007_ep_connected.v
    Based on the raw transistor netlist 001_top_unprocessed.v
    Ports have been added, guided by 006_mjb_sorted.v
    Nets have been repaired based on comments in 006_mjb_sorted.v

008_ep_extracted.v
    Automatic conversion of 007_ep_connected.v to RTL form
    Two-phase latch representation without tri-state elements
    Can be simulated using a plain digital simulator such as iverilog.
